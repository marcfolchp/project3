# Gamer's Galaxy Studios

## Welcome to Gamer's Galaxy Studios!

Gamer's Galaxy Studios is a budding game development company on a mission to create immersive and captivating gaming experiences for players worldwide. As we embark on our journey to bring your favorite virtual worlds to life, we're excited to share our plans for a new headquarters. We're currently exploring three potential locations for our state-of-the-art offices: the vibrant tech hub of San Francisco, the bustling cityscape of Chicago, and the tropical paradise of Honolulu.

## How it works

In our project, we harnessed the power of GeoJSON to pinpoint the optimal locations for our new offices in San Francisco, Chicago, and Honolulu. Using a random central point within each city, we defined a radius of 1 kilometer to create areas of interest. Our scoring system is designed to evaluate these areas based on their proximity to various key activities.

The scoring system assigns points to each location based on the availability of essential activities. If a location offers more than 8 of these activities within the defined radius, it earns a perfect score of 10. Scoring 9 means the location has more than 6 activities, while a score of 8 signifies more than 4 activities. Locations with 7 points offer more than 2 activities. Finally, 6 points are awarded if there are more than 1 activity.

This scoring system allows us to create a weighted overall average out of 10 for each city, helping us determine the most promising location for our new offices based on the range and quality of nearby activities.

## Results

After applying our scoring system to evaluate potential office locations in San Francisco, Chicago, and Honolulu, we obtained the following weighted overall scores:

San Francisco: Scored an impressive 7.4 out of 10, indicating a location with a substantial number of key activities within a 1-kilometer radius.

Chicago: Garnered a commendable score of 7.9 out of 10, signifying a city where our new offices would have access to numerous essential activities.

Honolulu: Achieved a score of 4.9 out of 10, indicating that while it offers some key activities, there may be fewer options compared to the other two cities.
